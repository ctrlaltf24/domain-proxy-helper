# Domain Socks Proxy Helper

Allows configuration of multiple socks proxies per domain.

Note: in order to populate DNS over socks:

- The global proxy setting is briefly set to each of your proxies on startup. Some of your requests when the browser is first starting may go through the socks proxy.
- Must have permission to run in private in order to set global proxy settings (See note on <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/proxy/settings> for why)

Fork of <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/containers-proxy-helper/> but modified to per-domain rather than per-container.
